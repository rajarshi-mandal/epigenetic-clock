# Interpretable epigenetic clock links aging pathways and disease-specific methylation profiles

We develop an interpretable blood-based epigenetic clock that estimates biological age and identifies disease-specific DNA methylation alterations. Using 8,233 Illumina methylomes from healthy controls and nine age-associated diseases, we used ridge selection to retain 4,855 CpGs and benchmarked 20 regression architectures with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Tree-boosting models performed best with the weighted ensemble achieved a MAE of 2.54 years on the hold-out testing data. PaCMAP embeddings revealed order within aging trajectories and disease-enriched neighborhoods. Interpretability linked recurrent CpG drivers to immune remodeling, inhibition, vascular programs, chromatic regulation, and metabolic stress. This highlighted loci in ELOVL2, FHL2, KLF14, CD8A, LAG3, SMAD2, and NSD1. In clinical cohorts, we quantified epigenetic age deviations with pronounced acceleration in stroke and shifts in several neurodegenerative conditions consistent with systemic inflammation. A CatBoost classifier accurately distinguished diseases though clinical validation on independent cohorts is required. This helped potential identified therapeutic targets and novel signaling pathway transformations.
